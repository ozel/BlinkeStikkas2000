## Preparations for BlinkeStikka Circuits Workshop

See Website of the [Swiss Mechatronic Art Society](https://mechatronicart.ch/x-mas-sticky-circuits-workshop/)

We have shifted the workshop to a mostly online hybrid format!!

This allows even more of you to join and participate in the collaborative design process of make your own “X-Mas Sticky Circuits”. Join us in the lab of our virtual 2d-World or directly join the jitsi-room if you have troubles with the map, or want to join from your phone.
